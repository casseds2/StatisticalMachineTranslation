TERMS:
-Match: words match and no tampering is needed
-Substitution: Replace one work with another
-Insertion: add word
-Deletion: Remove a word
-Levenshtein Distance: Minimum number of operations.

FORMULA: Insertions + Deletions + Substitutions / Reference Length

Insertions: {are, for} = 2
Deletions: {is} = 1
Substitutions: {official -> officials} = 1
